# Week 3 Alternative Assignment

This assignment tries to answer some fundamental questions about this course,
now that you are getting your feet wet with node and express.

Questions we'll try to answer are:

- What is a server?
A server is like a powerful computer that stores and manages information, as well as provides services to other computers or devices connected to it over a network. It's like a central hub that responds to requests from other computers (called clients), handling tasks like storing data, running applications, or delivering web pages.

- Why do we need servers?
We need it to store and manage data, like files or databases, to handle tasks that require a lot of computing power, such as running software applications, to allow multiple devices to share resources like files or printers, to host websites and web services that users access through the internet.

- How do web pages work?
When we open a web page in your browser, the browser sends a request to a server asking for a specific web page, then the server finds the requested page, which is usually written in HTML, the server sends back the HTML page along with other files like CSS, and JavaScript, and the browser then interprets these files to display the web page on your screen.

- What is the difference between HTML and JSON?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language): This is the language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It uses tags to define
elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms.
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON is a format used to exchange data between servers and web applications. It's easy for both    humans and computers to read and write. JSON is often used in APIs to send and receive data in a format that's easy to understand and work with.

- What is JSON good for?
JSON's simplicity, versatility, and efficiency make it a popular choice for data interchange and storage in modern web development and beyond. It provides a standardized way to structure and transmit data across different systems and platforms, facilitating seamless communication between applications.
